# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Absolutely, Manasa! Let’s create a **realistic project roadmap and timeline** for **Cottage 4.0**, assuming **one person (you) working with AI assistance**, covering **frontend, backend, Firebase integration, auctions, and testing**. I’ll break it into **phases**, with suggested durations and tasks.

Manual/admin approval can be enforced before activating farmer and cottager accounts, pending document review.

Document uploads should be securely stored (use Firebase Storage), and sensitive data encrypted in Firestore or a secure backend.
